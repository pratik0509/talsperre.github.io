                where the car (cyan bounding box) will turn left over the next 4 seconds. Using INFER, we predict this future trajectory, given the past 
                trajectory (the trail behind the car). The predicted future trajectory (orange) and the ground truth trajectory (blue) are projected on to the 
                image. On the top-right and bottom-right, we show zero-shot transfer results on the Cityscapes (using stereo) and Oxford Robot Car (using Lidar) 
                which demonstrates cross-sensor and varying driving scenario transferability. For visualization, we register the predicted and ground truth 
                trajectories in 3D for each of the dataset (shown below the image): The green 3D bounding box depicts the first sighting of the vehicle of 
                interest which is also when we start preconditioning, and the red 3D bounding box indicates the start of prediction. We also register the 
                Lidar/depth information (cyan-road, dark gray-lane, and magenta-road) to demonstrate the accuracy of our prediction.

        <h5 style="text-align: justify;">
            Deep learning methods have ushered in a new era for computer vision and robotics. With very accurate methods for object detection and semantic 
            segmentation, we are now at a juncture where we can envisage the application of these techniques to perform higher-order understanding. One such 
            application which we consider in this work, is predicting future states of traffic participants in urban driving scenarios. Specifically, we argue 
            that constructing intermediate representations of the world using off-the-shelf computer vision models for semantic segmentation and object 
            detection, we can train models that account for the multi-modality of future states, and at the same time transfer well across different train and 
            test distributions (datasets).

            Our approach, dubbed INFER (INtermediate representations for distant FuturE pRediction), involves training an autoregressive model that takes in an 
            intermediate representation of past states of the world, and predicts a multimodal distribution over plausible future states. The model consists of an 
            Encoder-Decoder with ConvLSTM present along the skip connections, and in between the Encoder-Decoder. The network takes an intermediate 
            representation of the scene and predicts the future locations of the Vehicle of Interest (VoI). We outperform the current best future prediction 
            model on KITTI while predicting deep into the future (3 sec, 4 sec) by a significant margin. Contrary to most approaches dealing with future 
            prediction that do not generalize well to datasets that they have not been trained on, we test our method on different datasets like Oxford RobotCar and 
            Cityscapes, and show that the network performs well across these datasets which differ in scene layout, weather conditions, and also generalizes well 
            across cross-sensor modalities. We carry out a thorough ablation study on our intermediate representation that captures the role played by different 
            semantics. We conclude the results section by showcasing an important use case of future prediction : multi object tracking and exhibit results on select 
            sequences from KITTI and Cityscapes.
